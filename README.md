# 🗺️ State Guess Game

A fun and educational interactive Python game that challenges users to guess all 50 U.S. states! Built using the `turtle` graphics library and `pandas`, this game helps improve geography skills while offering an engaging experience.


## 🎮 How It Works

- A blank U.S. map is displayed using Turtle graphics.
- The player is prompted to guess U.S. state names via text input.
- Correct guesses display the state name at the correct location on the map.
- The game continues until the player guesses all 50 states or exits early.

If the user chooses to exit, the program saves the remaining states to a CSV file for later practice.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive Turtle-based GUI
- Real-time input and feedback
- Data-driven using Pandas and a CSV file of states
- Missed states export for self-learning

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Turtle** (for graphics)
- **Pandas** (for data handling)

## 📁 Files

- `main.py` - Core game logic
- `50_states.csv` - Data file containing all U.S. state names and their coordinates
- `blank_states_img.gif` - Map background image used by the Turtle screen
- `states_to_learn.csv` - Auto-generated list of states the user didn't guess (created on exit)
